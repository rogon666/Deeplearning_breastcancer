## Pre-screening breast cancer with machine learning and deep learning_

Deep learning has been widely applied in breast cancer screening to analyze images obtained from X-rays, ultrasounds, magnetic resonances, and biopsies. We suggest that deep learning can also be used for pre-screening cancer by analyzing demographic and anthropometric information of patients, as well as biological markers obtained from routine blood samples and relative risks obtained from meta-analysis and international databases. We applied feature selection algorithms to a database of 116 women, including 52 healthy women and 64 women diagnosed with breast cancer, to identify the best pre-screening predictors of cancer. We utilized the best predictors to perform k-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments that compare deep learning against traditional machine learning algorithms. Our results indicate that a deep learning model with an input-layer architecture that is fine-tuned using feature selection can effectively distinguish between patients with and without cancer, since the average area under the curve (AUC) of a deep learning model is 87%, with a 95% confidence interval between 82% and 91%. Additionally, compared to machine learning, deep learning has the lowest uncertainty in its predictions, as indicated by its standard deviation of AUC equal to 0.0345.
